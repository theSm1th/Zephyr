## About Zephyr
Zephyr is a Discord bot primarily focusing on Warframe-related utilities - it has many features - most pertaining to *relics, and the prime part trading economy,* featuring data from [warframe.market](https://warframe.market). It also has other features pertaining to Warframe, with world data from [warframestat.us](https://warframestat.us).

It is *very* much still in development - and it's just a hobby project - so don't expect anything that isn't the average CompSci student's best.

That said, the development team for Zephyr consists of only two people:

## Driplomat:
*Lead Developer | Zephyr Prime Deluxe Enthusiast | Nidus Main*
